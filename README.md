Few days back, when i got so much addicted to cryptography, i came to know about the gravity falls. It is a very much famous cartoon containing a mysterious ciphertext at the end of each episodes.

I decided to make a tool to decrypt all of those encrypted texts. I will provide questions and answers and you tool (simply python code).

Things are so much straight forward. So happy watching and happy decoding!!
