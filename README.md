# The Numbers

Points:50

## Question:

```
The numbers... what do they mean?
```


## Hint:

```
The flag is in the format PICOCTF{}
```


# Solution:

  1.The hint means a lot here. Starting Alphabates of our Flag is PICOCTF.

  2.Comparing it with the digits given in the png FILE. we can conclude, they have assgined the numbers from 1-26 to A-Z.
   
  3.Just decode the digits accordingly.
  
  4.Take care while submitting a flag. Sometimes, Flag format sucks.

## Flag:

```
PICOCTF{THENUMBERSMASON}
```
