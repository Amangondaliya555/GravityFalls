Few days back, when i got so much addicted to cryptography, i came to know about the gravity falls. It is a very much famous cartoon containing a mysterious ciphertext at the end of every episode.

I decided to make a tool to decrypt all of those encrypted texts. I will upload here... 1.Encrypted Message 2.Tool(Simply Python Code) 3.Decrypted Message

Things are so much straight forward. So happy watching and happy decoding!!
